# Popcorn Cove Subscription Service

This app tracks customers' subscriptions boxes. The users can input new customers, search for existing customers, create a new subscription or modify an existing subscription. Finally the user can export all the subscription boxes going out that month to a spreadsheet and print out address shipping labels.

# TODO

- allow admin to delete customer
- add loading status to all AJAX buttons
- lazy load customers when searching (i.e. limit 10 on type ahead)
- add server logging support see https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xviii-deployment-on-heroku
