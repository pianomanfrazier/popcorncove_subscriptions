# Popcorn Cove Subscription Service

This app tracks customers' subscriptions boxes. The users can input new customers, search for existing customers, create a new subscription or modify an existing subscription. Finally the user can export all the subscription boxes going out that month to a spreadsheet and print out address shipping labels.
